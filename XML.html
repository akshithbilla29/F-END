        <h2>What is XML?</h2>
        <h5><li>XML (Extensible Markup Language) is a markup language that is designed to store, organize and transport data in a human-readable and machine-readable format. It is a simple and flexible text-based format that is widely used in various domains including web services, software development, data exchange and storage, and electronic publishing.</li>
        <li>XML consists of a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that can be easily read by both humans and machines. In XML, data is structured into elements, which are defined by tags. Each element can have attributes that provide additional information about the element.</li>
        <li>For example, consider the following XML snippet:<br>
<textarea name="" id="" cols="55" rows="13">
<bookstore>
    <book category="cooking">
        <title lang="en">Everyday Italian</title>
            <author>Giada De Laurentiis</author>
            <year>2005</year>
            <price>30.00</price>
    </book>
    <book category="children">
        <title lang="en">Harry Potter</title>
            <author>J.K. Rowling</author>
            <year>2005</year>
            <price>29.99</price>
    </book>
</bookstore>

‚≠êIn this example, the <bookstore> element contains two <book> elements, each with different attributes such as category. The <book> element in turn contains sub-elements such as <title>, <author>, <year> and <price>. These elements can be nested within each other to form a hierarchical structure.

    XML documents can be validated against a Document Type Definition (DTD) or an XML Schema, which provides a set of rules that define the structure and content of the XML document. This ensures that the XML document is well-formed and conforms to a specific format.
    
    XML can be used for a wide range of applications, including data exchange between different systems and platforms, document management, web services, and data storage. Its flexibility and extensibility make it a popular choice for developers and businesses alike.
